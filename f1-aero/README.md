## 🌟 Overview

I created this project to visualize the airflow around a Formula 1 car, simulating complex aerodynamic phenomena such as **Ground Effect**, **Venturi Tunnels**, and **Wake Turbulence** in real-time. By leveraging WebGPU Compute Shaders, it solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a high-resolution 3D grid (128x48x48) at interactive frame rates.

It serves as a tech demo to showcase the raw compute power available in modern web browsers without relying on heavy external game engines.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Volumetric 3D CFD**: Full 3D simulation using a Eulerian grid-based solver.

- **Ground Effect Simulation**: Visualizes low-pressure areas (suction) generated by the floor and diffuser (shown in magenta).

- **Active DRS (Drag Reduction System)**: Toggle the rear wing geometry in real-time to observe the reduction in drag and wake turbulence.

- **Interactive Controls**:

  - Adjust Wind Speed, Time Step, and Flow Decay.

  - **Substeps**: Boost simulation speed by running multiple physics steps per frame.

  - Move the car position to analyze upstream/downstream flow.

- **Orbit & Free Camera**: Inspect the flow from any angle with Unity-style controls.

## 🤝 Development Process

I built this project through an an intensive pair-programming session with **Google Gemini**.It stands as a testament to how human-AI collaboration can accelerate complex graphics engineering.

- **Concept & Direction**: I defined the aerodynamic scenarios, vehicle design (F1 2022+ regulations), and visual goals, focusing on the accurate representation of ground effects.

- **Core Implementation**: Gemini generated the WGSL compute shaders for the fluid solver (Advection, Divergence, Pressure Projection) and the raymarching renderer.

- **Optimization**: We iteratively tuned the grid size, time steps, and memory alignment to achieve stability on consumer hardware (e.g., RTX 3060) without diverging the simulation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **WebGPU (WGSL)**: Core physics solver (Advection, Divergence, Pressure Projection) and Raymarching renderer.

- **HTML5 / JavaScript**: Zero dependencies. No external math or physics libraries used (custom matrix/vector math included).

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

  ``` shell
  git clone [https://github.com/yn3104ao/webgpu-works.git](https://github.com/yn3104ao/webgpu-works.git)
  ```

2. Open index.html (or webgpu_f1_3d_stable.html) in a WebGPU-compatible browser (latest Chrome/Edge).

3. Enjoy!

## ⚠️ Requirements

- A browser with WebGPU support enabled (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, etc.).

- A decent dedicated GPU (e.g., RTX 3060 or higher recommended for high substeps).
