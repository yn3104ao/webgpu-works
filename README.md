# WebGPU Works 🧪

A collection of high-performance graphics and physics experiments running entirely in the browser, powered by **WebGPU**.

This repository serves as a personal playground to push the limits of modern web graphics without relying on heavy game engines.

## 🤝 Development Story

I built this project through an intensive pair-programming session with **Google Gemini**. It stands as a testament to how human-AI collaboration can accelerate complex graphics engineering.

- **Concept & Direction**: I defined the physics scenarios, visual aesthetics, and interaction models (e.g., F1 regulations, biological patterns, galaxy mergers).

- **Core Implementation**: Gemini generated the highly optimized WGSL compute shaders and boilerplates for the simulation loops.

- **Optimization**: We iteratively tuned grid sizes, time steps, and memory alignment to achieve 60 FPS stability on consumer hardware (e.g., RTX 3060).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Future ideas to explore the capabilities of WebGPU:

- [ ] 🤖 **In-Browser AI Vision**: Real-time 3D point cloud reconstruction from webcam feed using client-side ML models.

- [ ] ⚙️ **GPU Hardware Visualizer**: Educational visualizations of GPU architecture (e.g., Bitonic Sort, Warp Divergence).

- [ ] 🕯️ **Real-time Raytracing**: Photorealistic rendering with soft shadows and reflections.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: Raw WebGPU (WGSL), HTML5, JavaScript.

- **Dependencies**: None. (Zero-dependency philosophy; math libraries are inline).

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/yn3104ao/webgpu-works.git
```

2. Serve the directory using a local web server (e.g., VS Code "Live Server", Python `http.server`, or Node `http-server`).

  - Note: WebGPU requires a secure context (localhost or https).

3. Open `index.html` in a WebGPU-compatible browser (latest Chrome/Edge).

## ⚠️ Requirements

- A browser with W**ebGPU** support enabled (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, etc.).

- A dedicated GPU (RTX 3060 or equivalent) is recommended for high-fidelity simulations.
